Is there any option which controls the expansion of INCLUDE files and macro
definitions in assember listing output, so I don't have to mess with the
LIST option?  If not, could this go on the wish list?

     No.


Is there some automatic way for the macro processor to issue an error
message if it is passed more parameters than are defined in the macro?
Alternatively, is there a way for it to provide repetitive identical
handling of each parameter it is passed, in a variable-length parameter
list?

     Can check number of parameters passed, emit warning message -
     use:
               .IF \#>nn
               .MSG
               .ENDIF

     or, use:

               .FOR <symbol> IN \*     ; concatenation of all input args
               .........
               .ENDFOR


What are the parameters of the -Q option that make it effective?
Does it depend upon the size of the file being assembled?




What about automatic override of .AWORD for locally-defined long address
accesses?  (Check this first).  Or at least a warning of truncation?

     No problem dude, it covers it.



Is there a way to effect #define substitution of parentheses for square
brackets?
