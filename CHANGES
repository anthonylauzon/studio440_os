-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.13:

Sample dump, of course.

When creating sound (or loading 2000 sound from disk, or receive via SDS),
VCA release rate defaults to 10 instead of 40 -
mainly to ease sample start-point/end-point editing.

After sampling, sampled sound's kit is not automatically installed on pads.
(This was being done immediately upon sample return, and often caused
spurious changes to CURRENT_SOUND immediately following sampling, such that
new sample was usually lost.  Workaround - select sound for sampling using
pads, to avoid spurious change to different sample number).
See SET_ROOT_PITCH, SAMSUBS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.14

Minor modifications to sample dump header interpretation/generation:
on transmit, set loop points = end if loop mode = off.
on receive, set loop points = end if beyond end (per Akai S1000, P3000) -
               also, set loop mode = off if loop points are equal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.20

Same damned thing as 2.14, but formal release version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.21

Modification of SCSI routines to accommodate standard CCS drives.
Until further notice, limited to 100 banks per drive (approx 80 meg).
Added user_id_screen display to power-up procedure,
and encoded all power-up screens for obscurity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.22


09-May-90

Added resetjmp module, to permit standardized, constant entry address
upon power-up or other hard reset - used 100h as entry point.


21-Jun-90

space reclamation - begin with codecapp = 1f8de:
       .  removal of work loop function - codecapp = 1f4c8
       .  removal of drive_sel_sub - codecapp = 1f462
       .  removal of all code related to MTC clocking - codecapp = 1ec66


07-Aug-90

decode_scrnbuf moved from reset_44 into lcd as WRITE_ENCODED_SCREEN,
added to LCD_FUNS as WR_ENCD_SCRN.  now copies encoded text to screen
buffer and then decodes it, thus operates like WR_SCRN for encoded text.
also implemented DISP_ENCODED_SCREEN / DSP_ENCD_SCRN.

first-pass copy protection routines installed -
armed by user's first function switch hit, executed after timeout.


24-oct-90

change made in perf_mid to fix up a mapped-mode stuck-note bug -
refer to that file for details.
unprotected version given to peter rudolfi, who discovered the bug -
not sure if this included updated scsi stuff, or what became of the rom files.


09-oct-91

unprotected version custom-built for ken reyes - he got a syquest drive.
defeated copy-pro by removing backgrou branch to do_copypro_check.
just for the heck of it - did this by putting a conditional switch in equates.
don't forget that you did this!  maybe you'll put it back immediately ....
also updated stripinc.bat to reflect new environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.23


920813
restored absent smpte sync code from banished pro_mtc as pro_tcm.
a customized copy of this was shipped to luc allen.

921008
assorted changes to make the scsi implementation more robust
with respect to syquest/ccs drives.  eliminated user_id_screen
display as part of powerup init - this is for custom versions only.
reset procedure now explicitly initializes stack pointer,
for use with generic mon68k (hp64000 emulation monitor).

i called this version 2.30 - shipped it to dave seznak.
