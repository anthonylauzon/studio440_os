File name: RAMLINK.YES:
Presence of this file in a project directory indicates to batch procedures in
\DO.BAT and possible others that copies of the object modules generated by
the Uniware 68000 cross-assembler should be maintained on the RAM drive
currently in use for linking purposes.
When the size of the link makes this impossible, there should be no file
by this name in the project directory.
This will prevent unwanted buildup of object modules on the RAM drive,
which is nevertheless used to speed up assembly.
