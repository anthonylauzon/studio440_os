this is for the release version of scsi update



hit list:

    - move specific unchanging code blocks out of main link to
    fixed locations in separate load modules, to shrink size and
    duration of main link.  good candidates: tuning and other
    tables related to sound playback (eg, envelope rate tables),
    diagnostics, seqscope (softdiags), sample edit utils.

    - mods to load/save screen per chris meyer's suggestion -
    display of selected drive and bank in these screens.
    also, seems reasonable to permit alteration of these values
    here.

    - ideally, the save procedure should display the existing
    bank name and file type, if any, from the disk or bank to be
    saved to, as part of the not blank warning.

    - at boot-up or on scsi device reset, log all drives found to
    be present.  for those which are formatted to 440 system, log
    the directory size into an array which is used to set bank
    limits in bank select screens for load/save/etc operations.
    thus, must also remove hard limits on bank numbers here.
    for non-440 drives, this is set to 0 and prevents such
    operations.

    - how large can bank directory be without overflowing buffer?
    do we need to start using limbo ram space?

    - if not too difficult, figure out some way around the
    syquest error-after-cartrige-swap syndrome - perhaps a single
    retry on error would do the trick?  perhaps using a specific
    check for the error in question in conjunction with single
    retry.

    - wire in an omni mode for sds, make it the default.
    possibly a -1 or 127 value for dev id.

    - find and kill that damned midi kits tuning bug!  i mean,
    default all midi controllers to no routing into kits.

    - look at using midi sys rltm as play and stop switch
    actuators in internal timebase mode.

    - how about extending tempo range?  big deal?
