                     MIDI Sample Dump - Quick Instructions


         =========================== SETUP ===========================

         1.  Connect a MIDI cable from the Studio 440's MIDI OUT A to
             the MIDI IN jack of the other device.

         2.  Connect a MIDI cable from the other device's MIDI OUT to
             the MIDI IN jack of the Studio 440.

         3.  Set the Studio 440's MIDI IN channel to match that of the
             other device, or vice versa (don't worry about MIDI OUT
             channel or MIDI mode).

         4.  Make sure the sequencer is not running.

         The Studio 440 is now ready to receive sample dumps from the
         other device, and will also send samples out in response to
         dump requests from the other device.  You don't need to call
         up any specific screen.  To stop any sample transfer, hit the
         STOP switch.  If using the Studio 440 with a computer, you
         can ignore the rest of the quick instructions.


         =============== MANUALLY-INITIATED TRANSFERS ================

         Use when the "other device" is a sampler, not a computer.
         Hit the SYSTEM MIDI 2 button until the "MIDI sample dump"
         menu appears.

         ----------- TO DUMP A SAMPLE TO THE OTHER DEVICE ------------

         1.  Select "Dump sample" and hit ENTER.

         2.  Select the sample you wish to send (top line).

         3.  (Optional)  Select a different sample number to be sent
             with this sample to the other device (bottom line).

         3.  Hit ENTER again.  "Sending ...." should appear in screen.

         --------- TO REQUEST A SAMPLE FROM THE OTHER DEVICE ---------

         1.  Select "Request sample" and hit ENTER.

         2.  Select the sample number into which the Studio 440 should
             store the incoming sample (top line).

         3.  Select the number of the sample you want the other device
             to send (bottom line).

         4.  Hit ENTER again.  "Rcvng ...." should appear in screen.


                                Happy Dumping!

                 MIDI Sample Dump - The Long-winded Discussion


                         "For Those Who Love To Read"



         ===================== Product Overview ======================



         The MIDI Sample Dump feature of the Studio 440 allows direct
         digital transfer of samples via MIDI in either direction
         between the Studio 440 and any other sampler or computer
         which has a similar capability.  Among other possibilities,
         this feature extends the power of the Studio 440 in three
         significant ways:



         EASY ACCESS TO SOUND LIBRARIES WHICH EXIST ON OTHER SAMPLERS.

             Your Studio 440 sound library can now expand quickly by
             incorporating sounds created on other samplers, without
             the need to resample the sounds in an audio format.  The
             highest possible fidelity is retained, and loop points
             are preserved.  The Studio 440 can request samples from
             other samplers via MIDI, allowing it to be used with
             samplers which lack a manual-dump capability.


         ACCESS TO THE POWER OF COMPUTER-BASED SAMPLE EDITING.

             The Studio 440 can act as a "slave" to a computer running
             one of the many fine sample editing programs now
             available, allowing you to apply the greater resolution,
             extended editing functions and on-screen graphical
             techniques of these programs to the manipulation of your
             Studio 440 sounds.


         PRESERVATION OF YOUR INVESTMENT OF TIME AND EFFORT IN THE
         CREATION OF YOUR Studio 440 SOUND LIBRARY.

             If you choose to add another sampler to your setup, or to
             upgrade to a 16-bit system, your existing Studio 440
             sounds can be transferred to the new system with full
             fidelity and no need to resample.

         ============== SDS - What It Is, What It Isn't ==============


         The Studio 440 MIDI Sample Dump feature follows the
         specifications of the Sample Dump Standard (SDS) section of
         the Universal System Exclusive codes agreed upon by members
         of the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA).  The SDS specs
         define a communications protocol which permits the exchange
         of "raw" digital sound data between any two MIDI devices,
         regardless of differences between the internal sound formats
         used by each device (eg, 12-bit, 16-bit, linear, companded
         etc).  In addition, info on sample rate, loop points and loop
         mode is exchanged via the SDS protocol.  Virtually all
         samplers have enough in common to be able to use this
         information, and will recognize and use the same set of SDS
         messages in order to transfer it, translating it internally
         as necessary.  For example, the Studio 440 can receive
         samples from a 16-bit sampler and will store them as 12-bit
         samples internally.  You can also send the Studio 440's
         12-bit samples to a 16-bit sampler - the 16-bit machine will
         store them in its own 16-bit format, although the "quality"
         of the sample is still really 12 bits (so it may not sound
         any better in the 16-bit machine, but on the other hand it
         shouldn't sound any worse).

         However, beyond the basic level of sample handling - in the
         "playback control" department - samplers differ from one
         another to such an extent that there is no way to include
         such control information as part of the Sample Dump Standard.
         (For the Studio 440, control info includes VCA, VCF and
         pitch-bend envelopes, fine tuning, velocity-mod, sound names
         and just about everything else which is not under the SOUND
         EDIT 1 button).  This type of info, if made available, is
         encoded into manufacturer-specific, device-specific System
         Exclusive messages which are recognized only by another
         device of the same type, or by a computer patch-editing
         program designed specifically for that model.

         The Studio 440 does not currently generate or recognize
         System Exclusive messages of this second sort.  As a result,
         some of the capabilites of "universal" sample editing
         programs, such as Digidesign's Sound Designer II and Blank
         Software's Alchemy, will not be applicable to the Studio 440.
         For example, you won't be able to set filter cutoffs or
         create Studio 440 keyboard maps using these programs, nor
         translate these settings from the Studio 440 to a different
         sampler via the computer - these control functions require
         device-specific System Exclusive response beyond the scope of
         "plain vanilla" SDS.  The "universal" editing programs
         actually include special sections of software developed
         specifically for each of the samplers they support.  For this
         reason, the Studio 440 will not appear by name in the menus
         of any of these programs.  Nevertheless, the truly universal
         sample editing features of these programs will certainly work
         with the Studio 440 and its sounds.

         ======================== Setting Up =========================


         Cable Connections

         The Studio 440 performs SDS transfers with incoming messages
         received on the MIDI IN jack.  This should be connected to
         MIDI OUT on the other device.  Outgoing messages are sent via
         the MIDI OUT A jack.  This should be connected to MIDI IN on
         the other device.  The MIDI OUT B jack and the TERMINAL/SYNC
         jacks are not used for Studio 440 SDS transfers.

         Because of the way SDS works, it is best to use two MIDI
         cables and make both input and output connections to the
         appropriate jacks on the other device, even if you plan to
         transfer samples only in one direction.  Doing this allows
         for "closed loop" communication between the two devices and
         will result in faster transfers and smoother operation.  In
         fact, it is necessary to use the two-cable connection if you
         wish to use the dump request capability of either device.
         One example of this situation is using the Studio 440 with a
         computer-based sample editing program.

         However, if two-cable hookup is inconvenient, transfers can
         be made with a single cable connected appropriately for the
         desired transfer direction.  For this to work, it must be
         possible to initiate a sample dump manually on whichever
         device is the transmitter (the Studio 440 fully supports this
         mode of operation as well).


         Channel and Other Settings

         The MIDI channel number set for the Studio 440 must match
         that of the other device.  The Studio 440 ignores any and all
         SDS messages which do not appear on its selected channel.
         This is the IN:  channel which is set in the CHANNELS screen
         under the SYSTEM MIDI 1 button.  This channel is always in
         effect for SDS transfers, and applies to both incoming and
         outgoing SDS messages - the OUT:  channel set in the same
         screen is not used by the Studio 440 for SDS transfers, and
         setting it to "OFF" will not affect SDS operation.  Other
         MIDI settings on the Studio 440, such as "ECHO", "IN TO",
         "MTC" and "SOUND PERFORM MIDI MODE", also have no effect on
         SDS operation.

         Note that while most MIDI messages are confined to 16
         channels, the SDS spec allows for up to 127 channels.  Some
         devices allow you to use the full range of channel numbers
         for SDS transfers.  Because channel numbers above 16 are not
         allowed for "standard" MIDI messages, these devices will
         have a separate setting for the SDS channel number, which may
         be called something like "device ID".  If present, this is
         the channel which must match that of the Studio 440.  The
         Studio 440 performs SDS transfers on channels 1-16 only.

         ================= Remote Control Operation ==================


         Normally, the Studio 440 is ready to receive a sample dump or
         respond to a dump request at any time - all you need to do is
         send one on in.  This allows it to be used easily with a
         computer acting as the "master" device.  The main exception
         to this is that sample dumps and dump requests are ignored by
         the Studio 440 if the sequencer is running - incoming SDS
         messages will not cause the sequencer to stop, and may even
         get recorded into a sequence if RECORD is active at the time
         (this is NOT recommended, by the way).  Also, sample/sequence
         editing operations and disk operations usually lock out MIDI
         response and will prevent acknowledgement of these messages.


         The dump header - the first part of any sample dump - tells
         the Studio 440 what it needs to know about the sample being
         sent to it.  Most importantly, it indicates the size of the
         sample, and the sample number under which the new sample
         should be stored.  If there is not enough memory available in
         the 440 to store a sample of the indicated size, the 440 will
         send a message back to the transmitting device in an attempt
         to halt the incoming dump, and will ignore the dump if it
         comes in anyway (as might occur if the two-cable connection
         is not used).  A message will also appear in the display:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Sample too large³
                              ³- unable to rcv ³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         In addition, if the indicated sample number is already in use
         in the Studio 440, then the existing sample will have to be
         deleted before the new sample can be stored there.  In this
         case, the memory which would be freed by deleting the
         existing sample is taken into account when deciding if there
         is enough memory space to receive the new sound.  If not, the
         existing sound is not deleted, and the dump is rejected as
         discussed above.  Otherwise, the Studio 440 automatically
         deletes the sound, after first sending out a message telling
         the sender to wait.  This message appears:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Target sound is ³
                              ³being deleted...³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         and may remain for as long as several seconds.  After this,



         ----------- Remote Control Operation (continued) ------------


         data transfer should begin.  The following screen lets you
         know exactly what is happening:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Rcvng sample #12³
                              ³103472 wds to go³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         The number on the bottom line indicates the number of sample
         words the Studio 440 is still expecting to receive.
         Normally, you will see it going through a continuous rapid
         countdown.  If this number is not changing, it means that the
         transmitting device is not sending anything to the Studio
         440.  With some computers and other devices which may need to
         fetch sample data from disk during a transfer, it will be
         normal to see the countdown go through an occasional brief
         pause.  When the countdown goes to zero, you'll see this
         message:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Sample transfer ³
                              ³  is complete   ³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         This tells you that the Studio 440 is back in your hands and
         ready to resume normal operation.  At any time before the
         countdown reaches zero, you can abort the transfer by hitting
         the STOP switch (on the Studio 440 end, at least - the
         transmitting device may not get the message, in which case it
         will keep on sending).  If you do this, you may want to
         delete the partially-received sample before continuing, to
         avoid wasted memory space.


         Response to a received dump request message, apart from being
         completely automatic, is very similar to operation during a
         manually-initiated dump.  See the section below entitled
         "Function Screen 2 - Dumping Samples".

         See also the section below entitled "Sample Receive - Further
         Details" for more info on how the Studio 440 receives
         samples.



         ================= The SDS Function Screens ==================


         The function screens related to SDS operation are mostly
         useful for exchanging samples between the Studio 440 and
         another sampler.  When doing this, the Studio 440 can act as
         the "master" and control the other sampler.  If you are
         working with a computer, you shouldn't need to deal with
         these screens and functions - the Studio 440 is set up to
         work correctly with a computer when you turn it on.  Also,
         most computers will not respond to transfers initiated by the
         Studio 440 - the computer normally expects to be the master.

         The SDS function screens appear under the SYSTEM MIDI 2
         button.  You will initially see a single screen which looks
         like this:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³MIDI sample dump³
                              ³     Set options³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         This screen is actually a function menu.  The bottom line can
         be adjusted using the data slider or the INC/DEC keys to read
         "Set options", "Dump sample" or "Request sample".  Hit the
         ENTER key when you have selected the function you want, and
         you will obtain the associated function screen.  The
         individual function screens are discussed below.



         ========== Function Screen 1 - Sample Dump Options ==========


         Currently there is only one option, related to receiving
         sample dumps.  It's set in the following screen:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Rcv samp number:³
                              ³from dump header³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         This option determines where the Studio 440 gets the sample
         number under which it stores a received sample.  The screen
         above shows the default setting - the sample number is
         obtained from the dump header of the incoming sample.  This
         is the setting you will normally want to use.  Especially
         when using the Studio 440 with a computer-based sample
         editor, it's simplest to have the 440 act as a "slave" to the
         device which is sending it samples, and let the sending
         device be the "master" as far as controlling where its
         samples will go in the 440.  It's also what computers expect.

         On the other hand, when receiving samples from another
         sampler, it's likely that the sample numbers which that
         sampler sends will not match the numbering scheme you want to
         use in the 440 - you may want to decide this yourself on a
         sample-by-sample basis.  In this case, you'd use the other
         setting for this option:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Rcv samp number:³
                              ³from current snd³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         This indicates that the sample number in a received dump
         header will be ignored, and that any received sample will be
         stored under the "current" sound number.  Normally the
         current sound is the one that you played last, or whose
         number is displayed in one of the SOUND EDIT screens.
         (However, before you jump to this setting, be sure to read
         the section below on requesting samples from another
         sampler - this setting does not apply if you use the
         "Request sample" function of the Studio 440).



         ============ Function Screen 2 - Dumping Samples ============


         If you select "Dump sample" in the SDS menu and then hit the
         ENTER key, you'll see a screen which looks like this:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³ COWBELCH   #12 ³
                              ³send out as # 12³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         On the upper line you can select the sound to be sent out
         when the ENTER key is hit - the name of the sound appears
         alongside the sound number.  This is the Studio 440's
         "current" sound - thus, in addition to the data slider,
         decimal and INC/DEC keys, you can select this sound by
         playing it on the pads.  Also note that the ALT PARAMS key
         has an effect here - it will select the set of START/END and
         LOOP points to be used when the sound is transmitted.  The
         Studio 440 does not blindly transmit the entire sample, but
         instead sends the portion of it which is indicated by the
         currently active set of START/END points.

         On the bottom line you can select the sample number to be
         sent with this sample.  Any value in the range 1-256 can be
         used, since some samplers allow you to have many more than 32
         samples.  This number is inserted into the dump header
         message which is the first part of every outgoing sample dump
         - it tells the receiving sampler which sound number to assign
         to the incoming sample.  In general, by using this control,
         you can send Studio 440 samples exactly where you want them
         to go in the receiving sampler, without having to touch any
         of its controls (not always, however, since some samplers
         ignore this number when receiving sample dumps).  Note that
         whenever a different sample is selected for transmission,
         this number is automatically changed to match that of the
         selected sample - thus, in many cases, you won't need to
         specifically alter it.

         Hit the ENTER key to start sending.  You'll see a screen
         which looks like this:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Sending COWBELCH³
                              ³100440 wds to go³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         The number on the bottom line counts down to zero to indicate
         the progress of the transfer.  A completion message will
         appear when it reaches zero.  The countdown may pause one or
         more times during a transfer if the receiving device needs to
         allocate memory for the incoming sample or transfer data to
         disk.  Also, the Studio 440 will wait up to two seconds for a



         ------ Function Screen 2 - Dumping Samples (continued) ------


         response message from the receiving device after sending the
         dump header (which happens when you hit ENTER).  If you have
         correctly set up the two-cable connection, the transfer
         countdown will usually begin almost immediately - if you
         always get the two-second delay, you may want to recheck your
         connections.

         At any time before the countdown reaches zero, you can abort
         the transfer by hitting the STOP switch.  The Studio 440 will
         send a message to the receiving device which in most cases
         will convince it to stop listening and go back to standby.


         Sample transmit in response to a received dump request
         message is almost identical to manually-initiated transmit.
         The same countdown screen and completion message will appear.
         The main differences are 1) it happens under remote control
         (no buttons hit), and 2) the sample number in the outbound
         dump header is always that of the requested sample - no
         substitutions occur.

         See also the section below entitled "Sample Transmit -
         Further Details" for more info on how the Studio 440
         transmits samples.



         ========== Function Screen 3 - Requesting A Sample ==========


         If you select "Request sample" in the SDS menu and then hit
         the ENTER key, you'll see a screen which looks like this:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³Receive into #12³
                              ³req dump of # 12³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         On the upper line you can select the sound number to which
         the incoming sample will be assigned.  This is the number
         of the "current" sound - thus you can select it by hitting
         the pads, in addition to the other usual data entry methods.
         However, the ALT PARAMS switch has no effect here.  Note that
         if there is already a sound assigned to this number, it will
         automatically be deleted when the incoming sample arrives
         (unless the incoming sample is too large to fit into memory
         and is rejected).

         On the bottom line you indicate the number of the sample to
         be requested from the other device.  This number tracks the
         number in the top line, but can be changed to any value from
         1 through 256, to allow the Studio 440 to work with samplers
         which can have more than 32 samples.  It gets encoded into a
         dump request message which is sent out by the Studio 440 when
         you hit the ENTER switch.

         After sending the dump request, the Studio 440 goes back to
         standby.  It is up to the other sampler to respond with a
         sample dump.  If it does, then receive operation is exactly
         as described in the above section entitled "Remote Control
         Operation", with one small but significant difference:
         the Studio 440 will ignore the sample number which appears in
         the incoming dump header (normally the number of the sample
         you requested), and will store the sample under the Studio
         440's current sound number (which you selected in the top
         line of the request screen).  This happens regardless of the
         setting of the "Rcv samp number" option, provided that the
         other device responds within one second after the ENTER
         switch is hit.  During this time, the Studio 440 assumes that
         an incoming sample dump is a response to the dump request it
         sent, and overrides the setting of this option - this is why
         you will normally not need to change the setting of this
         option.

         If the other device does not respond, you will see:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³  Request sent, ³
                              ³no response seen³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ



         ---- Function Screen 3 - Requesting a Sample (continued) ----


         In addition to setup problems (recheck your MIDI cable
         connections and MIDI channel settings), there are legitimate
         reasons for failure to obtain a response:

         1.  You may have requested a sample with a number beyond the
             range which is recognized by the other sampler.

         2.  The sample you requested may be deleted, empty, nil, etc.

         Finally, there are some samplers which ignore the sample
         number in a dump request and respond to the request by
         sending whatever is their current sound.  When working with
         one of these devices, you'll have to adjust the current sound
         setting at both ends to achieve the desired transfer.

         Still with me?  You're pretty dedicated.  Pretty serious.
         Here are some more details you may find interesting.


         ============= Sample Receive - Further Details ==============


         Upon recognizing an incoming sample dump header, the MIDI
         response of the Studio 440 is always virtually immediate -
         either a CANCEL message if the sample can't be accepted, or a
         WAIT message to allow time for preparations to be made to
         accept the sample.  If the preparations include deleting an
         existing sample, there may be up to several seconds delay
         before the Studio 440 is ready to accept sample data.
         However, most SDS devices (including the Studio 440) will
         wait only two seconds after sending a dump header before they
         begin sending sample data, UNLESS they get a WAIT response
         back from the receiving device before then.  For this reason,
         the two-cable MIDI connection is always recommended.

         Basic SDS provides for the transfer of a minimal amount of
         info beyond the raw sample data itself.  Here's what the
         Studio 440 does with this info:

         1.  Sample rate.  Used to set the sample RATE of the received
             sample.  Rates below 20KHz get the 16KHz setting, rates
             between 20KHz and 35KHz get the 31KHz setting, and rates
             above 35KHz get the 42KHz setting.

         2.  Loop points.  Only one set is transmitted - the same LOOP
             values are stored in both non-ALT and ALT parameter sets.

         3.  Loop type.  SDS can indicate only forwards-only and
             backwards-forwards loops, or no loop.  The Studio 440
             uses the indicated loop TYPE, and sets up release loops.
             One special case:  if the received loop start and end
             points are equal, the loop TYPE is set to "LOOP OFF".

         All other sound parameters are set to default values exactly
         as though the sample had been created from scratch.  The
         default name "MIDIdata" is given to samples received over
         MIDI.



         ============= Sample Transmit - Further Details =============


         The Studio 440 will not respond to a dump request with a
         sample number higher than 32.  It will also ignore a dump
         request if the requested sample is deleted.  When a dump
         request is acknowledged and responded to, the sample number
         received in the dump request message is set as the new
         current sound before transmission begins.  MIDI response to a
         dump request, if any, is always immediate.

         When a sample is transmitted by the Studio 440 - in response
         to either manual initiation or a received dump request - the
         current sound and ALT PARAMS settings dictate what gets sent.

         The currently active START and END points delimit the
         "interesting" portion of the sample.  However, unlike the
         Studio 440, the SDS protocol does not provide for the
         transmission of START and END parameters - these are assumed
         to be the beginning and end of the transmitted sample.
         Because of this, the Studio 440 transmits samples starting
         from the START point.  This is used as the "zero" point, even
         though it may be set to some value other than zero in the
         Studio 440.  Sample transmission ends at the END point, and
         the LOOP points are sent with values which are relative to
         the START point.  Thus, whatever truncation you have used on
         a sound is preserved when the sound is transmitted.

         Because a sound may have different START and END points, LOOP
         points and/or LOOP TYPEs in its two parameter sets, it is
         important to pay attention to the ALT PARAMS setting when
         sending samples from the Studio 440.

         The LOOP TYPE value used by the Studio 440 in the outgoing
         dump header to indicate LOOP OFF is a recent addition to the
         Sample Dump Standard which is not recognized by all samplers.
         In order to be compatible with these devices, the Studio 440
         sends both loop points equal to the end of the sample when
         the sound being sent has a LOOP TYPE of LOOP OFF.
