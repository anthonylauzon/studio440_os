     "68000" directive must be deleted


     Option to suppress listing of INCLUDE files:

           INCLUDE files must contain conditional such as

               .OPTION LIST=LIST_INCLUDES

           at start of file, and end with

               .OPTION LIST="ON"

           The switch LIST_INCLUDES must be set elsewhere in source file,
           for example in a standard header INCLUDE file.


     TITLE - must change to TTL   or   .OPTION TITLE =


     ABS_SHORT - must change to .AWORD


     ABS_LONG - must change to .ALONG


     SKIP - must change to PAGE   or   .EJECT


     GLB - must change to .EXPORT   or   XDEF   or   .GLOBAL

           Note - .GLOBAL will .IMPORT any symbols not defined in current
           source file, thus is not as unambiguous as the other options
           and should probably be avoided.


     EXTERNAL - must change to .EXTERN   or   XDEF   or   .IMPORT


     HEX - requires a macro expansion


     [ and ] - must change to ( and )


     Locally-defined long addresses appear not to cause automatic override
     of 16-bit addressing -- look into it later.
